    "descriptionFromReview": "I agree so much with this review from 11 months ago. \"A city right out of a dystopian novel\" - that's what I was thinking on the way to the Airport after spending just a week in Bangkok.  A city right out of a dystopian novel - soulless and cynical. The air is polluted and no trees are in sight. Its inhabitants manipulative and cold-hearted - hidden behind fake smiles. A Disney Land for senile retirees. Everything is for sale and nothing has value. The streets are filled with rats - both human ones and animals. After spending time here, you understand why their king lives in Bavaria. A place that would make you feel deeply depressed if you stayed for too long. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I really enjoyed my first week here, but as I got to know more locals and heard their stories, I was disturbed at the security situation. Almost everyone I met has horror stories about being robbed at gunpoint, robbed by the police, and in one case even drugged and robbed by a taxi driver. It's not even safe to walk a short distance at night (locals told me to just take Uber). Beyond the security issues, scams also abound, and the covid policy is wacky, with hand sanitizer being forced on you everywhere you go (watch out: many of these products from Mexico contain toxic ingredients according to the FDA). Prices are similar to in Europe, yet security is much worse. In my book, that's a bad deal. I don't see myself spending much time here in the future.",

Yes, and there is a big digital nomad scene or community. On the other hand, residents are (at least in my opinion) not too friendly. As I speak Spanish very fluently (I personally come from Germany), I could figure out that many local people are jealous about our income (because most of us work in the IT and have a top income compared to Spanish employees) and about the fact that we can afford higher rents - consequently, we contribute to the increase of prices. At the beach, I could even follow a conversation between locals such as \"now due to the energy crisis, German people invade our island in order to save the high energy costs\". Besides, I didn't like the Canarian food too much, because in my opinion, it's too repetitive: grilled fish, grilled meat, potatoes with Mojo sauce - I was missing the skills and the finesse of the kitchen as you can find for example in France or in Italy. One outstanding point to emphasize: the Internet connection is brilliant, I had a 200 MB speed without any disruption.",

English speaking is okay. I did really enjoy a balance of simple, risk-free living at low cost and acceptable quality of living. Many places only accept cash but plenty accept card. There's lots to do and it's fun exploring on a moped/motorbike. It feels as easy as Canggu with more modern appointments to get by as a westerner a bit easier.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Bengaluru, January  4-9, and 13-13, 2020.  Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.  I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I wanted to share my experience as it's unlike any I've heard prior to my arrival. I've been in Cape Town for a month now and as a 24 yo woman traveling with 2 other friends I must say that I have never felt so unsafe. I stay in waterfront/ green point which are relatively very safe neighborhoods, yet I  get stalked every day, both my friends have been robbed in a safe area around lunch time. We have to really watch out where we're walking and what we're wearing. I'd say the crimes are very easily avoided if you take an uber everywhere so you can go from your house to the beach by car, than from your house to table mountain by car etc. I'd say that looks do matter, as 3 tall slim blond girls we're probably the worst demographic to go here. Also if we walk together there are no issues at all, yet walking alone is not really an option. With the exception of a couple streets you can sort-of-safely cross. We've done some charity work on the other side of the city, as its really needed and the human suffering can't be described. All 3 of us have been traveling for 5-10 years and we really thought we'd seen it all. Yet we've never come across such difference: the suffering is next to the luxury and the poor basically sleep on the parking sports where rich people can't even leave their car (cause it will be stolen).  The food is amazing, the people are nice, the country is beautiful, its very cheap to live a very good life here, yet I would never recommend this place to any young woman traveling without a male partner or friend.

Not ideal for a solo traveller as I was.  Overall, I really loved Ericeira but I definitely made a mistake going there solo during autumn/winter! Can see it being a great spot to live for couples/families provided you can afford it.  ",

I'd like to see the city in summer as it's just on the wrong side of comfortable and it rained quite a bit (I was there in December). Dog poo is seemingly an issue generally in Portugal...",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Kathmandu has frequent power outages as of December 2019 even though everyone says otherwise, as does Pokhara.  The old outages are referring to the load shedding issue which were routine power outages for the majority of the day.  Now power outages are not routine and can last unknown amounts of time, even the main (and only) airport loses power often.  Buildings are unheated, water for showering is generally unheated or lukewarm, many houses get their water from urban aquifers which may be heavily polluted, as city water is yellow and oily.  Many roads in the city are dirt, and air quality is extremely poor, especially during the crop burning season.  Locals are friendly and helpful and many outside of tourist areas may have never met a foreigner before.  The locals and the mountains make the place special, everything else about it is quite bad, notably hygiene, food safety, traffic danger, and exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants.  That said, I will be returning to visit the local friends made while there.",

It's a bit of an older vibe than Canggu, and there's certainly a big chunk of yogi's kicking around ‚Äî but I liked it much better than Canggu and found it less pretentious. Plus, you can drive down there in 45mins whenever you want some beach or party vibes.   As others mentioned, there's some great coworking spaces, cheap warungs, some really nice spots to stay cheaply if you go just outside of the mad touristy areas like Hanoman/Monkey Forest/Penestan.  You're definitely going to want a scooter, and you'll learn quickly which roads to avoid at what times because the traffic can be pretty crazy ‚Äî but that's true for Canggu as well.  It's green and lush, there's great food and a handful of good bars, lots of great pools and chillout spots, good yoga and gyms, and you're within 45mins ride of the beach, waterfalls, and jungles. Pretty damn good in my books.",

All of that you get for almost US-level prices.   Nah, I didn‚Äôt have a good time. It feels utterly derelict and careless. Zero things to do except paying through your nose for Safari stuff. Although the people are very friendly (if you sift through the ones that want your wallet). ",

City is relatively safe but you'll occasionally get harassed by beggars which can create a feeling of unease. Food is very meh, the best restaurants are the turkish/greek over the traditional \"serbian\" ones. Locals are generally nice and welcoming even if you're from the US, but the youth are obnoxious and loud especially at night. The smoking especially in indoor buildings is rude and obnoxious to most but not in Serbian culture.  Overall I would say 5/10. ",

You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets.  Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP.  Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art. A heartful people who have suffered insanely but still keep going, shows you the power of the human spirit to survive and thrive.  I like the place and will be back in summer.",

Nomad scene is here with a couple of Meetups and Activities if you look for it. It's relative cheap compare to West Europe. Food is difficult to find Restaurants what you can eat well.   Pros: Weather always perfect even in winter  It's an Island, so there are many beaches  2 Airports with many flights all over Europe   Fresh Fruits and Vegetable as many things grow here.  Cons: If you are a foodie its difficult to find any good food what is not Spanish or Italian  Even the Bus System is really good they need to improve with walkways or bike roads, but this is a problem in all over Spain.  Order online is a gamble sometimes is fast but as the Canary Islands are outside the European customs union you have to declare goods what the value us over 15o EUR ",

It has all of the convivences one could expect from the city except for an MRT system which as of September 2022, they are in the middle of building one anyway. Things are affordable although I have noticed a tamer street food scene compared to other places in Vietnam like Hanoi. Seems to be making more room for higher end dining but affordability is still easy. HCMC without a doubt has some great nightlife, so party animals are going to be very happy here. I am sure those willing to use grab or even rent a motorbike may find even more affordability outside of District 1.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Brasov is absolutely beautiful. Not a ton to do socially, and certainly no big nomad community. But the food is amazing, cost of living is cheap, and the parks and mountains surrounding you make it worth visiting! You can literally hike a gorgeous mountain walking about 5 minutes south of the old city center. It's also the most central location to visit nearby castles and national parks. You can buy tickets online and the trains are easy to navigate to get to places like Peles Castle in an hour or so. Highly recommend staying here a couple weeks! I hope to return.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Where cowboys and the wild west truly started, San Antonio is a beautiful and historic city with many layers to explore within and outside the city. It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "The city is quite pleasant. There are some good streets to walk. It never feels crowded, except the most touristic areas.  Architecture is interesting (but nothing to write home about) in a small touristic area, outside of it it's mostly ugly Soviet-era apartment blocks and ramshackle small houses. A couple of years ago the city was cheap, but now it's more expensive than many European cities and Asian capitals. When it was cheap, it was nice to stay there despite its drawbacks. Now it is very questionable. Drawbacks: - locals are somewhat unfriendly, nationalistic to quite high degree - they can either love you or hate you for nothing, and it happens in seconds - they drive like hell - food is the same in most places (though tasty) - low quality of everything: service, accomodations, goods etc. I'd say asian quality at european prices. I also didn't find the nature around Tbilisi particularly exciting. There is some beautiful nature in the country but it's far away from the capital.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Semiyak was my refuge from the crazy traffic, massive western crowds, mosquito attacks, and inflated prices of Canggu. Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak. Prices are better than Canggu but again, you need to dig a bit.",

The word traffic is misleading because it assumes movement, often during rush hour it can take 1.5 hours to go 10km (how do you like 3 hour daily commutes). The streets are chaotic like world war 3. If you get anxiety/claustrophobia this is not a place to be. Food is not great and unhealthy (lots of fried oily foods). And lots of garbage, litter, pollution just not a very pleasant place.

    "descriptionFromReview": "Taxis in Istanbul are a big problem even for locals. Public transport is convenient and comfortable. If you need to call a taxi, I recommend using an app. \"Bitaksi\" can be used. Agree with the taxi driver using google translate and negotiate in advance if necessary. Always make public transportation your first choice.  There are millions of refugees in this city against a registered population of 15 million. A significant number of asylum seekers do not have any registered documents and this creates various problems, so beware.  Nightlife is not recommended in Taksim. It is recommended that you prefer places such as Kadƒ±k√∂y or Be≈üikta≈ü, Sarƒ±yer.  Some of the foreign women I met said that they felt very safe in this city. This surprised me because I don't think so. But local young women are very sensitive and can always help you. If you are a friendly person, you will not have a hard time making friends.  As a negative feature, I can say that house rents are high.  You should prefer places that are more familiar to tourists. I can recomend Kadƒ±k√∂y.  A substantial portion of university students have English.  You can have great food and wander around one of the oldest cities in history. There are great cafes in √úsk√ºdar, Bakƒ±rk√∂y, Kadƒ±k√∂y and Balat. Especially Balat is a nice place.",

It's not really a community of its own, although that's changing as people move north from being priced out of the Canggu Airbnb market.  Seseh is built mostly on \"green land\", or land zoned for nature use rather than commercial or residential use. For this reason, land is scarce and rentals are quite expensive, with some Airbnb properties exceeding $6000 USD/mo.   There is an enclave of expensive Airbnbs next to Seseh Beach which has nice homes. Good for a well-to-do family. Not worth it if you're single, as you will be quite isolated here and you'll need to drive ~25 minutes to get to Canggu proper.  WiFi speeds are slow and wifi coverage can be spotty. Don't recommend if you need low latency for your work.  Not a lot going on at night or during the day here. It's very quiet. Not a lot of shops, restaurants, or things to do other than the beach. You're a bit too far for Gojek delivery from Canggu restaurants.  4/10 for digital nomads 8/10 for families with kids who want a big property and beach access. ",

Plenty of authentic Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese options for about 50% of what you would pay in a Western city.  Decent hostels will cost $11-$15 weekdays and between $18-$30 on weekends....  Good internet; beautiful architecture and people but it is true Hungarians can be very cold at times.  Overall a good stay with many destinations just a quick and cheap flight/train ride away (Bratislava/Belgrade/Vienna,Bucharest/Sofia/Prague and several Polish cities .",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Unless you want to spend the whole ski season in an outdated, tiny, crowded and poorly manage ski resort and terrible town and atmosphere, there‚Äôs nothing worth noting to do in Bansko.  Food is horrible, with no real healthy options to eat outside. Very limited and low quality products supermarket. Almost all restaurants have typical ski resort offers for all the British you will find here. Yes, tons of them come for vacations and the resort gets so crowded that even in the best days only a couple of hours have good enough conditions. And that‚Äôs if you can make it in the first hours. Even the ‚Äúfast line‚Äù gets packed with tourists with ‚Äúvip tickets‚Äù bought from some hotels and agencies. Long waiting hours await you not only in the gondola but almost every lift.  People are unfriendly, service is bad. You‚Äôre supposed to pay for a coworking to be involved in any social event. The ‚Äúcoworking Bansko‚Äù cult led by its weird founder is specially known for being extra exclusive and unfriendly with people outside of the coworking space.  The gyms are small and only one has good enough quality. It‚Äôs cheap, but it gets crowded easily due to its small size and limited capabilities. You won‚Äôt be able to workout properly if you want to do advance stuff.  Bansko‚Äôs overall price of living compared to its value it‚Äôs very high, not only because prices are not as cheap as you could imagine but because quality is terribly low. In my whole life of travelling I haven‚Äôt found a place where the standards for everything are so low.",

Lots of great restaurants, cafes etc. Nice easy access to the beach, riverside and countryside.  Nightlife is quieter, but if you don't care about that, it's great.  The Hub coworking there is run by some super friendly people and the new location they are building looks like it should be fantastic..  ",

I've been working in Maakri area, which is local City. Really loved my time here, especially variety of quality food options available. My favourite upscale place to eat was FARM restaurant, which is a gem of a resto located in the beginning of Tallinn's Old Town. The restaurant is also the only provence style restaurant in the country, according to my understanding.",

There are a bunch of expats here, and a lot them are involved in social projects. If you're looking to do something good beyond experiencing a country, it's a good place to start.  WiFi is totally usable everywhere. Mobile data is cheap and fast.  Siem Reap has tons of options for food and drinks. It's very easy to get around or foot/bike now because they built a new, fit for purpose road with a CYCLE LANE all along the river.  I disagree that's there's not much to do - there's plenty in and around the city. The circus for me is a must-see. Angkor Wat is obviously amazing - take a bicycle because you get more out of it. Definitely go and see Apopo - they train rats to find landmines and it's such a good initiative. I liked the lotus farm too.   Places to stay - would recommend the Bygone. You could easily live there for a month. The owners are super chilled and friendly. They're also using the business to support charity so totally worthwhile. ",

As someone mentioned there is definitely the traditional Southern European cafes are for socializing, not working kind of vibe but still a decent number had wifi and didn't bat an eye at working all day.

Tiny place that revolves around surfing and skateboarding (fishing isn't as prevalent as I was expecting and much less compared to Essaouira). It's also not as 'sleepy' as everyone describes and not as cheap. Everyone knows each other and it's easy to dig into berber culture. Start with the taxi rank manager and ask about pretty much anything. Moroccan's love to help. You'll be sold weed every 10 meters, make of that what you will. Best things to do here are eat, surf and relax. Seems like a lot of construction and investment is going into this place so catch it while it's 'quiet'. I'd avoid staying on the main street as it's loud pretty much all the time with dogs barking, cats fighting, etc. I found Booking (website) to be the cheapest accommodation but nothing beats landing and getting stuck in to find a place for even cheaper. There is no bank machine in Taghazout. One in the Radisson nearby (when it works) and the next closest is Tamraght (I found one that doesn't charge). Sunny and chill. Fun if you like surfing and relaxing on the beach.",

I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude. I stupidly went on the hike less than a week after I arrived and it was brutal. I'd wait until you have more time to acclimate to the height.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mauritius is indeed a great place to live in as a Digital Nomad ! They have recently released the Premium Visa for digital nomads that allows to live on the island for at least 1 year (renewable). Best places to live in are the North (very well developed with all facilities and business centres) and the West of the island (more for those who prefer to surf the waves and hike the mountains in between 2 video calls !).   The Mauritians are very welcoming and smiling people. I am not the first one to be touched deeply by their generosity. Food is very nice, people are helping, music and culture are the best. Wind in the South is perfect for kite surfing, wind foil, windsurf, etc  There are also new coworking spaces opening all around the island and you can hop from The Hive coworking spaces to a nice South African caf√© such as Bloom in the North or to a tea place/colonial house such as Les Aubineaux in the centre of the island. All with nice wifi and great vibes.   My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits.    I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually.   Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.

There are a few caf√©s and some nice bars but nothing really special plus. I really don't mean to be rude but Czech people are no fun. It's just...boring and dull. Generally speaking people here, even millennials, don't speak English. I found it very hard to do basic stuff like go to stores in the supermarket because nobody speaks English. There are waaaay better places to go to as an expat, Prague is one of those. ",

It's very resorty and there's some horrific tourist hellholes like 'Grandworld' which is an imitation world that is monstrously large and destroying the island.  However, there are some really good restaurants. Inland you can find some nice hiking spots and viewpoints (they're not easy to find). The waterfalls are nice if you hike further up them away from the piles of trash left by the locals.   We stayed at Phu Quoc ecolodge which was stunning and really a good place to work. Good WiFi, provide free and delicious tea all day and such a good range of drinks. Also kikicoconut would be nice to stay at - was our other option and we got to know the owner.  I'd say it's worth going to if you're in Vietnam and fancy going to an island. Just avoid staying in a resort.",

BUT the situation with food is very complicated, is hard to find literally anything, there are queues everywhere. The internet is expensive (2.5 GB of LTE for 8 dollars) and very unstable. If you don't need so much internet to your work and if you are patient enough, you can enjoy Havana as it is really interesting and unique city.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Generally favorable on Antalya, but not perfect. The weather was excellent (~26 C almost every day) and the nature of the city is absolutely stunning. The mountains on the west side of the city seem to just explode out of the ocean and it's special to see. That said, the built environment is pretty uninspiring. The center of the city is full of interesting restaurants and shops, but outside of the old town it's not very exciting to look at. My primary complaint, however, is on public transit. It's easy to use the tram to get to/from the airport and bus station, but outside of those destinations you better be ready to walk (or use a cab, which I try to never do). Wifi was solid but I did have some drops here and there, my apartment was decent, and the city felt pretty safe. It's also incredibly cheap. I tend to be very frugal, so take this with a grain of salt, but you can easily get a quality meal for about $4 US and would have no problem getting an awesome meal for $8 US. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have wanted to stay much longer than the two weeks I was there.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Dubai is good if you‚Äôve figured out a way to pay 0 income tax and live in 2 places (away doing vacations during the summer) - bonus if you don‚Äôt spend money on alcohol.  Nightlife is amazing, especially if you‚Äôre a woman. Free unlimited drinks for ladies, open bar, no catch, in two clubs in Media One Tower on Thursday. There is no place in the world that offers this. My female friends love Dubai because of these types of deals lol.   The easiest way to waste money here is by buying drinks. Search for ‚Äúcruise liquor bags‚Äù on Amazon, and buy alcohol in bulk and sneak it in. No one body-checks here because it‚Äôs very safe with no crime.   You live in the city, but super close to a beach. It‚Äôs still pretty cheap if you compare similar places like Miami.   Great home base to travel from and set up your life. Convenience of flights and 0% income tax. I would recommend this for a part time digital nomad that is looking for a base of operations. Also, tons of other contacts you can make who also love traveling and have disposable income.  ",

The light rail is a handy automated above ground rail to use. The line goes into Gimhae, to the Gimhae International Airport, and slightly into Busan before having to shift to another metro or transportation line.  Gimhae also has a Costco and major supermarkets. The street art is also quirky.",

The flair is not international, but terribly German-conservative. There is neither an interesting start-up nor a tech community. Many people are unfriendly when you speak English. The leisure activities outside Munich (nature) are nice, unfortunately there is not much going on in the city compared to London, Berlin or Barcelona. In Germany, everyone seems to want to go to Berlin, so if you don't, I recommend looking at Hamburg or Cologne - but unfortunately not Munich. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Okay so this is coming from a person born and raised in Szczecin:  Pros: - cheap - decent public transport - bolt and uber - clean and safe (for the most part) - I find it beautiful - close to, and well communicated with Berlin and its airport (with buses and trains) - close enough to the sea to go on weekend trips - other pros generally applicable to Poland - decent level of english, not 3rd level world healthcare, beautiful girls  Cons: - literally 2 co-working spaces + a few cafes to work from (honourable mention: Corona Coffee) - boring asf, nothing is happening during the week and it's also pretty empty on the weekends, literally 2 spots to hang around (Deptak Bogus≈Çawa and Bulwary [this one only during summer, and you will see a lot of drunk teenagers but it's not bad])  - no nomads and very limited amount foreigners, it's Szczecin not warszawa - the 'Szczecin' airport is pretty far away and domestic flights are expensive in general (flight to warsaw is around 300-500PLN one way)  It's a decent base to come back to in between trips, and also pretty nice to come and see but I'd not stay here for long as a nomad.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I stayed in Pokhara for a few months and it is a friendly place with a good music scene. there are plenty of amazing trekking opportunities around in the Himalayas. the people are very friendly and it's easy to make friends. Lots of travelers here are smoking weed, it seems to be pretty legal here. internet speeds are good (probably 15 up and down on average but I stayed in one place that was hitting 30) but power cuts are frequent in the summer (monsoon) months. Many hotels, guest houses, airbnbs are fitted with an inverter to combat this (which basically means one or two sockets and lights in the place will still work during a power cut, so make sure your place has an inverter and your modem is plugged into one of the working sockets. No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must! If you are doing research about Pokhara and you are worried about load shedding, rest assured it doesn't happen anymore (just be aware of the power outages in the monsoon months).",

Pros: friendly people in the city (not so much in the far North rural areas of Rwanda if you travel on your own near Virunga). Clean air. A few good restaurants. Safe in the city (Kigali), even at night. Amazing wildlife and scenery/landscapes if you get a place with a good view and some nature around. Government entities have their sh*t straight more than many other nations. Average internet. Stable power grid. Cons: dangerous near Virunga unless you go on a guided tour, water is unpotable and unsafe from the tap unless boiled even in Kigali, locals stare at you without interruption (not in a frightening way but it's uncomfortable), dangerous to navigate the traffic unless you're used to complete road chaos, slow/poor service in restaurants, everyone asks you for money even the children in rural villages where tourists don‚Äôt go, need a car/motorcycle to do anything (not a walkable city), very poor selection of anything in terms of shopping needs and expensive. There's a lot of potential here and I'd gladly come back overall, just watch your safety (health, road, and up North).",

From here, you can go to the famous Railay beach with a longtail boat within 15 minutes and also the tours to Phi Phi and Hong Island start from here. There is a club called Upbeat Bar/Loft RNB in the middle of Ao Nang that gets kinda busy, although not super crowded in the rainy season. Maybe main season is different. Stay away from Krabi Town however, its just an ugly town without anything to do and its not possible to get a taxi to Ao Nang after 10-11pm. Stay around Ao Nang!",

For the most part, it's orientated around suburbian living. The main city (Johannesburg CBD) is for the most part a no-go because of crime, but if you know some locals you should definitely check it out there are amazing restaurants, theatres and museums to experience there.   Having lived here for 30+ years, I'd recommend checking out Sandton CBD, restaurants in Linden, Wanderers and Bryanston, and  rent a car to drive out to The Cradle of Humankind, and visit the Maropeng museum there. There is a lot to do here, you just need to think and act like a local.   If you are travelling to Johannesburg, I also feel like you'd be doing yourself a diss service by not planning a trip to The Kruger National Park. ",

It is possible to go there by train and the view during traveling Sarajevo-Mostar is spectacular. Mostar has a small airport but is not functioning most of the time.  Hotels, hostels, and apartments are affordable and look good.  Food offers a lot of red meat, but it's possible to do a good combination of cheese, bread, salads, and seafood.  WiFi is not the best.  There are a few points in the town that should be seen but mostly Mostar is a service town with nightlife, restaurants, and coffee places. It's quite lovely all of it, but besides it, the town doesn't offer a lot.  However, this part of Bosnia is beautiful and it is possible to see the different places around by staying in Mostar. It's a small region and in slow motion, five to seven days is more than enough. I have been several times and springs and autumns are the best, while winters are quite cold even without snow. Summers are unbearable, but it's possible to be on the sea cost in 45 minutes by car.  Services in the restaurants and general communication (busses, cabs, hosts, hospitals, stores) are not satisfactory, but traveling around I figured out they just behave that way, it shouldn't be taken personally.  If you are an outdoor person, there are mountains, rivers, and walking tours you shouldn't miss.   ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I've been in Phuket for about a month now. Most of that time I've spent in Ka Ron and Kata beach area, but also have been to Chalong, Pa Tong, Rawai, and Kathu.   Karon and Kata beaches are my favorite. Beaches are beautiful, especially Karon. Overall most everything is reasonably priced, but not the bargain I was told it is. I eventually found a hotel I like, where I pay 12-13 euro per night (below 500 baht atm) and that is by far the lowest I found for the quality I expect. Considering the location (close to the beach), internet connectivity, room size, quality of amenities, and the staff, it is a very good deal. However, most hotels I have been to were just lacking. It's hard to find one that has a desk suitable for work in the room. Internet is a hit or miss at best. You would think with fiberoptic cables on each pole every place would have amazing internet, but it's not that simple. Hotels being hotels, sometimes you have to go through bullshit complimentary wifi logins, which expire at random times etc. I am not the coffee shop nomad type, but even that seems to not quite work in the areas I visited - I've seen some coffee places, but they are quite empty. It's off season still, I am being told. Come October, we shall see.   Another poster mentioned that the vibe is \"not there yet\". I think it's fair to say the vibe is \"no longer here\". Most everything strikes me as old and barely maintained. The vast majority of hotels, restaurants, and coffee places I have either visited or considered reek of late 90s/early 2000s at best. A dangerous combination considering how humid it can get here.   Touts are very annoying and some of them are either desperate or simply stupid. Some of them I pass 3-4 times a day, they definitely remember me and they will still yell at me \"TUK TUK!\" or \"CUSTOM MADE SUIT!\". At one point I got so annoyed that I asked the guy if he is going to ask me about the damn suit every single time he sees me and he used that as an opportunity to offer it to me again. It's even more annoying with \"massage parlours\" (i.e. brothels), especially if you are a man. I guess you just have to learn to treat them like air. I find it hard, because when somebody greets me or waves at me it is natural for me to wave back or respond and that's all they need to feel invited to sell harder.   Another poster mentioned prostitution. Yes, it's here and it's hard to miss. You may want to not notice it, but it sure as hell will notice you. In general, the more party oriented the place, the more \"freelancers\" are around. Pa Tong was very bad in this regard. I would strongly advise against going there unless you have a particular business to attend to, e.g. extending your visa. Most massage parlours are simply brothels, but not all. I think it's quite easy to tell the difference. For one, workers at a genuine massage parlour will not be overly exposing themselves. Some will add \"no sex\" on their banners. In general, the more professional the place looks the higher the chance it's not a brothel. Of course, nobody will force you to get a happy ending, you can get just the massage, but if it's at a brothel the quality of service will be low since it's not really what they are there to sell.   But enough of complaining. Let's mention the good bits.    The food is great, easily accessible, and cheap. Not as cheap as street food in the normie-local parts of Bangkok (everything is touristy here), but still very cheap compared to anywhere in Europe or the US. In general, I find that the more crude and local the place looks, the cheaper and better the food is. Even better, a local grill stall that opens up very early and closes shortly after 1PM - clearly there to feed locals going to work in the morning. The worst meals I had were served in \"food and live music\" places clearly catering to tourists and those were severely overpriced too (still cheap compared to Europe, but apples to apples...)   People are very nice, carefree, smiling, welcoming, and chatty. Of course they don't have the easiest of lives, but they seem not to excessively worry about it. I like Thais, they are very warm and kind (unless they drive tuk tuks or sell custom made suits, though some of the latter seem to be Indians). I smile at them and they always smile back, something that's not so common in some parts of the world. It's quite amazing how much can be discussed with gestures, pointing at things, and smiling. Don't expect English proficiency anywhere on the island, with rare exceptions and those do come with heavy accent too. I mention it because some people, like me, may find the accent very hard to understand.   It's clean. There is no litter on the streets or beaches. I did see some plastic bags/cups/other items in the ocean, but it's been infrequent and it doesn't accumulate on the shore. It is clear there is an effort to keep the place clean. Coming from a very clean country, I appreciate that a lot and it makes me respect the locals even more. I don't think this is specific to Phuket. I had the same impression in Bangkok. Considering the climate and population density, things could have been so much worse and yet they aren't.   Overall, I am glad I came here and I may stay a little longer. Will probably come back. I can see myself visiting regularly, but not sure if I could live here. At the end of the day, English proficiency is way too low and I am not convinced I have enough motivation to learn Thai.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I am a Greek living abroad just the last couple of years. I accidentally discovered this page and noticed the comments below. What I can recommend to people considering living in Athens is to explore places a bit outside of the city center. I agree with people that there are many areas very close to the city center that are dirty and perhaps not very safe to walk around at night. Explore areas like Glyfada, Voula, Kifisia, Marousi, Psychiko, Marousi and you will be amazed with how different it is! The quality of life in such areas area way way WAY better than what you get by living in the city center. If you don't have a car, top tip would be to find a place with a metro station nearby.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I'm Polish and I've been to Gda≈Ñsk a number of times over the course of the last 10 years. When I was younger and have seen and experienced less, I was very impressed by the old town. However, these days, after having seen most of Europe and some of the US, I can't help but feel that Gdansk's old town is small and everything that surrounds it has a distinct, post-communist feel, which I do not enjoy. I was there this summer (2022) and it felt like being in an amusement park, with many of the apartment complexes around the old town turning into cheap, short stay aparthotels. The place felt empty due to that. The biggest allure of the city is that it is so close to the sea. Unfortunately, as locals would tell you, it is extremely crowded when the weather is nice, therefore most locals avoid the sea in the summer, which to me sounds weird. Considering the climate, I wouldn't want to be near that sea outside of the summer time!  To end this review on a more positive note, I think the city is well connected with the municipal rail making all parts accessible. It is very green outside of the old town and the air quality is the best among largest Polish cities. For foreigners, I think Gda≈Ñsk is a must see and as other commenters here noted, it's a good place to nomad from.",

If you want to genuinely experience the overall area or its history you'll want to visit both Ybor City and St Petersburg (First two areas that were initially settled). Clearwater is a tourist trap but has a beautiful manufactured beach (the sand as imported to make this beach what it is today).   Saint Petersburg, FL:  St Petersburg offers a few co-working spaces and at one time boasted the largest number of Kava Bars in a given city in the US (which are often used as cowork space by locals). The Brewery scene in St Petersburg is unmatched, with over 50 different breweries located in Pinellas County alone.   Nightlife: EDM/Dance Music is primarily seen in Tampa/Ybor City especially for harder genres like Dubstep/Riddim and Drum & Bass, as well as Tech House. However, St Petersburg has a reputation for being the more artistic side of the Tampa Bay area and thus has a strong community for Techno and House music.   Daytime Fun: - Kayaking through the mangroves in Lido Key (Day trip) - 'Hiking' in Weedon Island Preserve - Daytime in Ybor City (great restaurants, bars, and a bit of history) - Busch Gardens Theme Park (Excellent rollercoasters) - Art walk in St Pete - Dali Museum (St Pete) - Fort Desoto  Cons: -5 years ago Tampa Bay was extremely affordable by all accounts, but is currently pacing to become much more expensive with a 25% increase in housing costs in the last year alone and one of the highest overall inflation rates in the country. -Traveling around Tampa Bay can become expensive due to the physical size of the city and how scattered things can be. Public transit is not worth the money saved, but if you're remaining in one area, Uber is very reasonably priced.  -There are a lot of people from other cities in the US moving into Tampa Bay, so there are many people that are not a reflection of the locals here.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Great for a visit. Beautiful scenery. Good food. I thought it would be great to live here, start a startup and be in the same time zone as SF, close to Seattle, etc. But compared to Vancouver in 2009, one big change that totally ruined it for me: Absolute zombie apocalypse of drug addicts and shouting/violent home less people. It was shockingly bad. The locals often visibly carry naxalone (anti-overdose medicine, I learned) because there are so many people overdosing in the street. Police were nowhere to be seen. Such a shame, I would have loved to live in this beautiful city otherwise. ",

Not too expensive (~$2100 for a nice 2 bedroom apt) for the U.S. Has wineries and breweries galore. Not a great place if you are a recovering alcoholic (!). Cons: extremely hot in the summer; reaches 110 F (43.3 C) in summer afternoons from June - September. Not very diverse. Highways are loud and obnoxious. ",

Its city CBD is so much fun as well. You can visit the Queen Victoria market which is the largest outdoors market in the world! You can also visit Federation Square which is a beautiful park on the edge of the CBD, and you can visit the Eureka Skydeck and Australia 108 which are the tallest buildings in Australia if you exclude the antenna from the Gold Coast's Q1 tower. If you are into surfing, there are surf beaches about a 1-2 hour drive out of the Melbourne area at the nearest. Melbourne is a really good city to reside in if you like fun, but of course it does come with a cost. Melbourne is the 6th most expensive city in the world according to recent reports. Overall, an awesome city",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Uluwatu is an amazing place, in my opinion way better than Canggu and even Ubud. Why? There‚Äôs not much traffic, beaches are amazing, there‚Äôs a significant Brazilian/Portuguese community around which reflects in ethnic restaurants pretty good and affordable. Surf culture is present, so the laid back lifestyle. Maybe it‚Äôs hard to find an actual ‚Äúhome‚Äù, I always prefer to stay in cheap guesthouses such as 3D Homestay, with a nice swimming pool. Enjoy the morning in the beach and catch the unforgettable sunsets (don‚Äôt miss Uluwatu Temple!), get the work done by noon when it‚Äôs too hot to get outside.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Did the previous reviewer say world class art and culture?  Where would this be because after 2 years there, I was craving art and culture.  Like, my experience is the polar opposite so unless art includes street statues that happen a month of each year and if by culture meaning you run into a single black guy on the street, I don't get it.  It's really white, very few Hispanics, almost no blacks and few Asians.  No museums (outside of historical ones).  Most of the Mormons live in Provo if that matters. There weren't really any sketchy areas I've encountered in SLC.  SLC is a good city to visit especially if you're skiing.  If you're not skiing, I don't know what else you can do.  I found the city to be quite boring.    The national parks in eastern and southern UT are gorgeous but we're talking 4-8 hour drive away. Skiing is great. I personally like Park City but it's boring there too. Dating sucks all around. Between recovering Mormons to Mormons, there aren't a lot in between even if the city attracts non-mormons to work there.  And if you're not white, it'll be a struggle in the dating scene.  SLC nightlife is dominated mainly by college kids.  There's only 3 places that I'd consider hanging at as a 30's and up nomad and they're not very close to each other.  It's a walkable city although things are a bit spread apart.    The new SLC airport did not consider those who fly on airlines other than Delta. It's a 20 minute walk to get from check in to the furthest gate in terminal B.  Imagine old folks and handicap.  Crazy.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Florianopolis is absolutely beautiful. Amazing beaches and hiking. The seafood here is incredible.  YOU NEED A CAR HERE. This place is hard to navigate without a vehicle. Public transportation and uber aren't great.   I think this is an amazing place to go with someone else. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a long term solo traveler. The reason for that is I found the people to be a bit cold. I approached a lot of people and the interactions always felt so strange. IMO not a great place to mingle with the locals. They just seemed a bit standoffish and cold (I also have heard from other Brazilians that people from the south are cold. In comparison to Sao Paulo the people are so much more friendly and welcoming). It's much easier to mingle with the other foreigners. ",

Plenty of excursions and day trips including Atlas mountains, Sahara, Essaouira and surrounding towns/villages to get you out of Marrakech but living staying a long time is too much.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I recently stayed in an apt at Cascade. I loved being within walking distance of everything: cafes, bars, restaurants, museums, parks, money exchanges, groceries, etc. The most wonderful part for me was the ability to strike up conversation with strangers. Everyone there is just so friendly and accomodating. Also, safety. I arrived at 4am and was stuck outside with my belongings, in the middle of the city, for an hour waiting for my host. I've never felt this safe in a metropolitan area before. My main complaint is that internet connectivity needs improvement across the board. However, I was able to work for 2 weeks, even uploading video. But it is definitely not up to par with other places I've visited. I plan on returning for a longer stay soon.",

Boring, I don't mind the weather so much but I agree with previous reviews about people here having poor social skills and making friends with the locals is VERY hard. This has been confirmed by my other expat friends from US and Europe who lived here for a bit. People overall are very serious and in a group setting things like real estate and social justice/ equality are normally main topics of the conversation. Very little culture in terms of art, museums, history etc.  Food is crazy expensive.  Summers are great because of the sunny, hot weather but the lake is cold and dirty. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Porto Alegre (POA) is a city brimming with beautiful Nature. Trees and birds galore. Unfortunately, there is much wasted potential where historical architecture and intelligent zoning are concerned. I've traveled throughout Brazil and lived in Sao Paulo, and I can attest that POA has the best food hands down. Customer service is top notch, and the shopping is good. Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure.   Gauchos are the most \"talkative\" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists / braggarts gets draining.  After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people. NOTE: In the countryside, the Gauchos tend to be polite, modest, and well-mannered. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mumbai, August 28-September 2, September 7, September 11 2019.  Got a friend to pick me up at the airport, so I can't evaluate how well UBER works from the airport. Prepaid taxi from the airport is my usual recommendation, and if I was traveling tomorrow that is what I would do. Inside of Mumbai, UBER was my go-to app and worked well.  Autos (aka 'Tuk-tuks' in some places)  get around well and are cheap, some are also on Uber.  Be aware that unless you use a service like UBER, as a foreigner, the price will go up if you do not look and act like a local when you flag down your ride.  Food was varied and can be had in any variety, veg or non=veg, any nationality or region.  Alcohol is available if you seek it out (some places will even deliver it to you with your pizza :).  There are bars and night life in Mumbai that are fun, and feel free to get swept up in festival crowds in the earlier parts of the evening in major metropolitan areas. I never felt unsafe in Mumbai, but do not throw good traveler caution to the wind here.  Internet was spotty at times, but that may have just been my location.  The internet tunnel I  used worked, but YMMV.  JIO was my phone provider of choice, and it seemed to work all across India. The city is historic and modern, slow and fast, very very rich, and desperately poor. Although prices here are higher relative to all other places in India, I will return to Mumbai (Bombay), and you should too... no one person can ever see it all.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Sri Lanka is a great country to visit and explore on vacation, but it is not good for nomading. The internet is the worst I've experienced in 3 years of travelling around SE Asia. Usually I would supplement terrible wifi with mobile data but I found this also terrible. I visited several places in Sri Lanka, including supposedly up-and-coming nomad destination Welligama. There are very few cafes that are fit for working (almost none with AC/power), Western food is expensive (and so is Sri Lankan food if you're in an area that is suitable for working online), and most of the accommodation is quite expensive if you want high standards. Definitely visit this beautiful country with it's friendly local people, but don't expect to be productive here.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Visited in February of 2019, the week before Carnival. Great time to visit as there were hardly any tourists and only a few other travelers. Downside is a lot of the restaurants aren't open and some tours are shut down. Upside is you get to live like a local in a insanely touristy town 10 months of the year. We were able to grab a very nice 1 bedroom apartment in the old town center with a kitchen for 150 euros for 5 nights (30 euros/n). Probably 10-15 restaurants were open in the old town, including the main grocery store. It appeared most everything was getting ready to open for Carnival, which probably marks the end of the lowest season (Few days after New Year's to Carnival). We did all the touristy stuff, and saw no other International travelers but a few random couples and one Chinese tour bus that overnighted (Right as COVID was taking hold...) We walked the walls and saw less than 20 people in 2 hours. If you want to avoid the crowds you can't beat Dubrovnik in the winter.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "The town has been taken over by tourists. Local music venues that have been around for 50+ years are closing because they can't afford the rent hikes. Tourism + out of town developers are driving prices for locals up and the job market can't keep up (minimum wage is still $7.25 an hour.) It would be possible to increase minimum wage, protect small business, and local cost of living if the state wasn't controlled by conservative republicans who won't pass any useful legislation to aid with the economic divide. But sure, let's spend  $500 million to build a brand a second football stadium. I digress.  If you do visit, please stay at a hotel instead of an Airbnb. Low-income neighborhoods are being bulldozed and gentrified by developers to build 4 story houses ideal for investment property owners seeking to rent it out as an Airbnb. (This impacts pricing for both local home buyers as well as renters.)  Last, but not least, PLEASE tip service industry workers (servers, drivers, performers, bartenders, etc.) If you can afford to visit, you can afford to tip. Thank you!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Great city in Southern Taiwan on a major port.  Lots of stuff to do if you like the outdoors. A mountain to climb, a beach to go to, and trains and buses readily available to go to surrounding outdoor activities.  Cons: English speaking is not great, but the locals are. And even if you don't speak Mandarin they will do their best to help you. Plenty of English speaking doctors, dentists etc. Most restaurants have a double menu. So it's not that big of a con and there are many classes that will help you learn at least the basics.   Pollution and Air Quality are terrible, not so bad that you can't go out and can't function, but the south is home to lots of refineries and factories that pay their way out of keeping up to standards and the air from China blows right over the western part of the Island compacted by a mountain range from the central to eastern part of the Island so no where for the bad air to escape too. Lived in Kaohsiung 3 different times for a year each time and it is not unbearable if you don't have any breathing or allergy conditions.   Scooters/ Also a Pro? There is a very clean efficient Metro but lines are lacking making it hard to get out to the neighborhoods that don't have easy access (Eastern Kaohsiung). The government is cracking down on crappy old polluting scooters, but that doesn't really help the people that like to drive on sidewalks and such.   Traffic Laws and signals ignored - The government has installed cameras and over the years things have gotten better, but the lack of regard for traffic laws does make driving and walking dangerous. It's probably the biggest flaw within the control of the local people and government. There are hardly any sidewalks (especially in the older neighborhoods) so it does make you keep up your alertness while walking or biking around town.   Pros: Aside from the traffic wildness, the whole country is extremely safe and most people are honest. Women are safe, children are safe, elderly people are safe. As a young woman never felt unsafe. Can walk anywhere at 3 am. If not for the pollution this is where I would want to raise a family.   Parks- Lots of parks in the city, lots of things to do and see in them.   Museums- Lots of museums and everything is in English in all of the major ones. Great for children and school trips.  Community- Not just with all the Expats, Nomads, English teachers, but also friends with many locals. It's easy to make friends if you take the time. Join sports leagues, dance classes, jiu-jitsu classes, art classes you'll make plenty of friends and the local friends will help you to experience the actual culture of Taiwan, which is worth coming for. It also helps with learning the language to get over a bit of the culture shock of being illiterate. Of Europe, The American, (have yet been to Africa), this was culturally the coolest and most interesting of all of the places I've been. Just so much history and culture on this tiny Island.  Culture - Maternal Culture, I use to threaten kids by calling the head of the family, aka Grandma. Aboriginal, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, and US all wrapped into one tiny place. Festivals year-round.  Food - Excellent, even for picky eaters, but better if you're adventurous. Cheap food that's great, Western restaurants while more expensive are still really good and comparable to prices overseas, it's not crazy expensive.  Costco locations and carrefour so you have access to most of the goods you can get at home in Canada, Australia the US or Western Europe.   Affordable 2 bedrooms, new, non-luxury around 17,000NTD. Luxury New around 24,000NTD, older not luxury less than 12000NTD.   Wifi and Technology in general - Great Wifi, Great prices on Computers and tech stuff. Even a whole street dedicated to selling and fixing computers in a central location.  Cafe's - Lots of cafes with wifi, free wifi mostly everywhere though. Coffee culture was hardly there 12 years ago, it's a relatively new concept, but it's growing exponentially, check out SPR coffee.   Healthcare - Great and reasonably priced. Have been in accidents and have been injured playing sports. Even if you aren't on the national health care, healthcare is easy to get and affordable, minimal fees. A serious accident/injury/illness would require some insurance though so check into that when you get here.  Some miscellaneous stuff:  Nightlife is so-so, Not many nightclubs, but the ones that do exist are okay and you'll find it hard to leave before daybreak. At which point you'll be able to hit up a breakfast shop before going home to pass out til noon (life as a young English teacher, or sometimes a major social event in which every English speaking local and Expat/foreign student shows up)  The weather is hot most of the year. Summer is brutally hot, but fall and spring are nice if you like around 26 or so. Winter is nice, but it can get cold, there is no heat in the apartments. By cold I mean the occassional string where the temperatures dip to around 10 or so. sometimes cooler. Doesn't last long, but does happen. You can buy heaters almost anywhere if you need them.   It is really easy to get around Taiwan, via buses and trains. Busy during holidays so keep that into consideration. They are also very affordable. There is so much to do. Mountains, Festivals all the time year-round, Kenting(south), Taroko Gorge(northeast), The eastern side of the island is gorgeous and less populated. Air Quality is much better on the other side of the mountains. If you're a city mouse and you like getting out, Taiwan is a great place to be.   Bureaucracy exists for visas and other life stuff, but given the language barrier, doing this kind of stuff in Taiwan is substantially easier than even being a citizen and the bureaucratic crap we put up with in western countries, especially Europe and visa processes. A dream compared to the American/Canadian processes. Most of the people that stay here for a long period of time and get their APRC(permanent residents) will tell you it's because life here is easy. And it is, if you make a certain threshold 2000 USD you'll live like a king or queen. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Not gonna lie, I was pretty curious and kinda hyped before I came to Singapore. However, within 24 hours all of my curiosity turned into disappointment. Yes, Singapore is clean by any standards but especially by Asian standards. And yes, you have shopping malls, fancy skyscrapers and free toilets everywhere.   But beside from that Singapore is boring and has no soul. It just seems like Singapore tries to copy interesting parts of other countries and their nature. Take Cloud Forest for example which is nothing more than a copycat of an actual cloud forest. Floral Fantasy is trying to bring blossoms in the cold reality of concrete and glass of Singapore. Gardens by the Bay is a park which is hyped because of its supertrees but actually quite boring, if you go for a walk. Those plus several different examples create the impression that Singapore is like the one kid in class which is trying really hard to get the attention but still doesn't have any friends.   Also, Singapore is all about money. It's about seeing and being seen. It feels like a big show off, almost no matter where you go. Everything seems so superficial.  Prices are ridiculous, too. Because Singapore has a bare minimum of agriculture everything needs to get imported, which will hurt your bank balance... a lot.   Pros:  - you can hop from one air-con-zone to the next - clean, like to an extend where you'd eat from the street. This is impressive, not gonna lie.  - shopping heaven if you're into that and have the money to spend - Little India is great and offers tasty food for cheap prices if you don't mind hanging with the \"poor\" people - great airport with an incredible amount of connections in Asia and Oceania  Cons:  - expensive to an extend which seems unfathomable in Asia - pretentious AF - polished and hollow - actually boring  If you have some money to spend and love Gin, go to ATLAS. It offers over 1300 different Gins from around the world. Their creme brulee is great, too! ",

Possibly one of the last major metropolitan areas in the US where housing is still relatively affordable if you have a good job. Lots of music venues and outdoorsy culture. It's colder than you can even imagine in the winter but that's a fun experience. Shoulder seasons are short, and summer is hot and muggy. Good food.",

You would have to locate many via google maps though. 1 month stays are trending on the island as well for Korean remote workers. The free coworking space in Jeju city still exists.  New hotels are popping up as well.  Pandemic travel to the island has given it more life from mainland Koreans. It's good to see the new growth and tech efforts.  Jeju still has a lot more potential for the future. It's still a good value for a modern island lifestyle.",

I live here, and honestly, it's a decent cheap Canadian capital, I can live while doing my hobby here, and sharing a house. It could be a lot worse if you're thinking of coming to Canada for a while, rent can be found relatively low cost and utilities are cheap too. Meals vary, of course the locals know where the good cheap places are, I like the $5 tacos at BMC market. It is flat and very cold in the winter so do be prepared, Winnipeg is merciless that way.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I was in Anjuna, Goa for Feb 23 and I can only discourage you from going there.  We were recommended the place as an upcoming nomad place but it just doesnt work for nomads at all.  Internet is plain terrible. Even in the coworking (NomadGao, Clay etc) and a back up sim, you cant make calls reliably to save your life.  Next to no community there, but strong hippie and party crowd there.  The streets are very stressful and you have to be comfortable driving a scooter in hectic streets in bad conditions. The police will stop you daily if you look like a tourist to shake you down for money, driving license or helmet.  The value for money was the worst I ever saw. Accommodation was a real pain as no place would divert much at all from their daily rate, even with local friends making the negotiations for us. After a frustrating weel long search, we ended up spending 940$ for a month in a loud apartment by the street (lots of honking) just because the bathroom didnt reek.  Overall, if you are considering working from Goa. Just don't. ",

Prices aren't cheap in comparison to other cities in the east of Germany. Also, don't expect older people to be super open to strangers, if you don't speak German. If you want a Berlinish vibe Kollwitz is the place to be. Everything is super walkable or bikeable which is amazing. Can recommend going there.",

I stayed at the Borneo Seahare Guesthouse for about 5 months. It is run by a western guy called Ben and his wife Syeda, they really helped me out with everything I needed and gave me a very reasonable rate on a private room. The internet was good and the place had everything I needed including a full kitchen for me to cook. Based right in the city center with loads of shops, restaurants and bars close by.  I can highly recommended Kuching its a wonderful city and I will be returning next year for sure! ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I've made Quito my base and it has its pros and cons. It's not a lively city but there's still decent events if you know where to go to. I recommend staying in La Carolina, more specifically around avenida Portugal. El Cafecito in La Mariscal is my favourite place to work from (they have great breakfasts). Locals are very polite but not the most extroverted. Another downside of Quito is that due to the US dollar, everything is a bit more pricey than in other latinamerican capitals (e.g. Lima, Bogot√°). On the plus side, there's many tax advantages for europeans working online as a contractor and I actually end up saving a lot of money that way.",

No problem to buy alcoholic drinks in any supermarket. Also, there are several good wineries near the city where you can go for a wine tour. - wonderful friendly people who will love your children as their own - fast and reasonably priced mobile internet (but do not buy a sim card in the airport)  Cons - in many parts of the city it is not convenient to walk: pavements are mostly narrow and bumpy and traffic lights work in a weird way - not so many people speak English, but usually, people are friendly and open to communicating via google translator - not enough options for short-term accommodation: several good Airbnbs and expensive hotels of international chains are good. Unfortunately, I didn't find any good hostels there. And economic hotels are mostly outdated and usually based in depressive neighborhoods. Hope the situation will change soon. - many neighborhoods look depressive, but the city is developing and getting more attractive. While you are in Alsancak, Bostanli-Karsiyaka, or several places in Bornova and Bayrakli - everything is perfect and safe. By the way, Izmir is a very safe city.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent 4 months working here during summertime. It's one of the best summers I have ever had in my life. The city is just amazing and offers dozens of outdoor activities. There are so many different places such as parks, lakes, hills, mountains, beaches, etc. Also, you can feel the Californication vibe on every step.  I lived in Hollywood and I would avoid this place at any cost. It's just too overrated and won't meet your expectations. Hollywood (esp. West Hollywood) is a big pile of dirtiness with people wandering around. I'd suggest looking for smaller neighborhoods preferably in The Valley. That area is just lovely. Also, anything close to Santa Monica is overwhelming yet too costly.  One of the things I also didn't like was the lack of cultural influence and this is for sure not a city that will offer nice architecture. Another thing I disliked was the huge social distancing towards foreigners which is most likely part of the American culture. If you were to make deeper friendships here, this is not a place to go. You will end up getting ignored and in the worst case, people will stop any contact with you.  Also, the public transport of LA is not reliable especially if you use bus transportation. Get ready to wait a long turn before you get to a bus. I suggest either using the metro or renting a car which is probably the best option in LA. Otherwise, get prepared for long walks throughout your place of stay.  With all of the above said, I will for sure return to this city again and can't say I'm not missing it. It's one of those places where you always want to get back, at least temporarily :D",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Stayed a whole month in Fort Kochi area, eventually going to Ernakulam (downtown area). It is unarguably very different than rest of India, much more cleaner and with friendlier people. Beaches aren`t nice for bathing but are a great choice to catch sunsets everyday. Cost of living is dirty cheap and public transport is good. They even have a subway crossing the city with reminds me the BTS in Bangkok. Actually, Kochi to me is like a small and boring version of Bangkok, which is good if you need a cheap place to get the work done while enjoy the sunsets and South Indian food.",

Going to Gringo Tuesdays is a very touristy thing, I only ever went once everyone is 25 and trying to get laid basically, and its P$11,000 a beer, my local pub sells beer for $P2,000 by comparison. The longer you are here the more you discover. The \"centre\" of the city is really from 83rd-93rd-115th roughly, 83rd has loads of great clubs and restaurants and getting an uber at 2am is perfectly safe. Don't be hanging round calle 13 or something, visit and leave before dark! The further north you go the safer it is, above Parque 93 its probably safer than NY. There are a lot of WeWorks and the internet is super fast, I have 350MB broadband in my house, a six bedroom house with 1/4 acre garden for $400k. ScotiaBank/Colpatria gives you the best exchange rate.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Las Vegas is a great tourist destination for me personally. The strip contains every amenities that I need and also there is a lot of stuff to do there without going away from the strip. Las Vegas is inside of a desert so expect it to be really hot in the summer. Otherwise than that, the strip located in Vegas has many things to do, from going to concerts, fancy restaurants, gambling (if that's your thing), attractions (stratosphere, high roller), entertainments, and so many more things to do that I will have to come back to it as soon as I can. Be aware that there are some generally bad spots in Las Vegas, but as long as you are within the strip, you will be safe. The things that I loved to do whenever going to Vegas is to try some popular restaurant or the bar and also staying in one of the hotels which is luxurious and one of it's kind. Unlike other hotels, the ones in Vegas are completely worth it and if you've ever been to a hotel in a rural area, the differences between the two will be night and day. There are many things to do here and my review is just a small part of it, I'll definitely come back here as soon as I can.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent a month in Tirana in February 2022 and then returned in October for a one-week stay. Generally, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend Tirana. Here are my Pros and Cons:  Pros: - Cheap: Airbnbs are cheap (especially on a monthly basis), food is very cheap (around a third of what you would pay in Germany) and still good quality (most of the time). - Walkable: The city center is pretty compact and everything can be reached on foot - Green: The city center has multiple parks around the main boulevard. The big city park has an artificial lake and paths for runners and cyclists. - Nice People: All locals that I talked to were very nice. I once went to the barber who was the nicest dude ever. We talked for around 1.5 hours about Albania, politics, economics and so on. That way, I learned a lot about the country. - Great coworking cafes: I can recommend the Destil Creative Hub and the Coolab. Nice people, good coffee and a good internet connection. Stay away from the #TECHSPACE, though. Very bad internet, tedious to even get in, not a good experience there. - Safe: I never felt unsafe, even when walking back to my Airbnb at night. There also were a lot of women walking around at night. Also, locals told me that pickpocketing is not a problem in Tirana since there are only few tourists. - Night Life: There are many bars around the city center. Even during the week, there are many people out partying.  Cons: - Boring: There is not much to do generally. There are a few museums like the National History Museum, the two Bunk'art museums (old bunkers from communist times) and the House of Leaves. All of them are focused on Albanian History. I can especially recommend Bunk'art 1. It's impressive to wander through this huge bunker. The National History Museum starts strong with a really cool exhibition of relicts and statues from Ancient times on the ground floor. On the top floors, most texts are not translated into English. Also, the exhibitions are partially very old school or trashy (the exhibition about Mother Teresa looks like it was designed by a child in Word 2003). - No digital nomad community: I would have loved to meet more digital nomads, but sadly there is no real community there (yet). - Cars: Traffic is insane in the city. And people drive like crazy. Take care when walking over the road (even at crosswalks). I was almost hit by a car on the crosswalk twice. Also, I was surprised that I made it from the airport to the city and back without an accident, considering the driving style of most drivers. - Coldness: Since it's pretty hot in Albania for most of the year, most buildings don't have heating or well-isolated walls (apartments as well as restaurants, museums etc.). I was there in February and I was constantly cold. So I would recommend visiting Tirana in spring or autumn when it's neither cold nor super hot. In October, the temperature was nice. - Public Toilets: Toilets in public places and restaurants are mostly filthy and unhygienic. Most places don't have urinals, still most men appear to urinate standing up and have terrible aim. That leads to piss being all over the toilet and on the floor. It was like this almost everywhere I went.  Generally, I enjoyed my time in Tirana and I definitely plan to visit a third time. I can recommend it to everyone, but especially to people who are on a budget.  In spring, you can get a nice Airbnb in the city center for around 500‚Ç¨ - 700‚Ç¨ a month, WizzAir offers cheap flights to Tirana from many major European cities (100‚Ç¨ - 150‚Ç¨ there and back) and food is pretty cheap (main course + drink around 10‚Ç¨ at most restaurants). So I estimate you can visit Tirana for a month at around 1000‚Ç¨ - 1400‚Ç¨ in spring.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Just came back from my second proper trip to Copenhagen. Now, I've been there in February and August, which is a huge contrast in this city.   Winter:  Copenhagen is great for cafes, working in them and experiencing the \"hygge\" (coziness) lifestyle. Why? Because the weather is so cold, windy and partly rainy that you just don't want to spend time outside. If you have someone to cuddle with, I highly recommend going there in Winter.   Summer:  Just amazing. If the weather is good you have several places to hang out. Right sea-side you have several options to go for a swim, work out or run along the seaside. Also, if you're biker, you'll love Copenhagen because everything is bikeable.   In general I would say Copenhagen is a great city to see but if you don't want to spend shitloads of money, then just go there for a weekend. Airfare is quite cheap if you come from one of the major airports in Europe (I came from Frankfurt).   Pros:  - beautiful seaside with great possibilities - nice cafes to experience the hygge-lifestyle - friendly and open people - bikeable - some nice vegan places (Kaf for vegan cakes and Riz Raz for an amazing veggie/vegan buffet)  Cons:  - horribly expensive (like seriously. I paid around 16 ‚Ç¨ for a noodle box) - depressing when cold - seriously horribly expensive  Would I go there again? Yes, but probaly only in summer and for around 3 days. That's enough to see most of it. ",

Petrol sold here only met the Euro 3-4 emission standard. Most vehicles on the road do not meet the minimum emission standard. The locals burn their rubbish which includes burning plastic. Everywhere is pretty much the rubbish bin for many locals. Infrastructures are not well maintained. Definitely not a picturesque city except for the trees planted in city centres. The \"parks\" here are more like green pockets surrounded by heavy traffics. Not quite functioning as a park where you can chill. It's a fairly safe city but nothing is particularly interesting. Most working spaces free from air pollution would be in shopping malls. But they're currently having many restrictions to get in (as of 9/4/2021). Houses here are not designed to bear the humid tropical heat and are heavily reliant on AC. Healthy foods are expensive therefore not accessible to everyone even though it is a basic human right. The overall quality of life I'd rate 5/10.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Nice clean city with lots to do if you're into sports and outdoor activities. Pretty good rec leagues (hockey, baseball, etc.) and probably the only city in North America with a full motocross track in the city centre. Also have kart racing nearby (Strathmore) and indoor/outdoor skydiving. Also lots of mountain biking, rock climbing, and hiking within a short drive (Maclean Creek, Drumheller, mountains). Obviously great snowboarding and skiing both in the city (Canadian Olympic Park) and nearby mountains.  For those who aren't into sports or the like the city might be a bit boring. The downtown core is coming back after the recession but still not as lively as many other metropolitans. Definitely a car based city once you get outside the city core but city is investing in subway system so that might get better in next few years.",

The Sea Garden is amazing and you see so many people doing sports activities, jogging, gym in the park etc. The center of the city is the best part along with the Sea Garden, beaches are nice and has airport that starts to get traffic also in winter season. It is peaceful city and in terms of food and friendly people it is great. The downside is during winter you have not much to do and I have heard there are sometimes shortage of water for locals.",

Boring town, super conservative and newly built strip malls that each feature 1 salon or beauty shop, 1 whitewashed mildly ethnic restaurant, 1 bbq or sandwich place, 1 store selling either vitamins or tangentially MLM related items, a tax preparation place, and 1 tea place.  Huge number of dental offices. Tons of big churches full of big hair, cowboy boots, and not a lot of anyone who seems truly to have faith, which I could respect. Decent population of college frat boys who call you ma'am.  As a city, it occupies the same mental space as a \"Target\" store but more racist. ",

It's definitely a gem, with not so many distractions and perfect to get the work done.  Coimbra has all the qualities of Portugal cities such as food, wine, safety, cultural events etc, everything quite low-cost oriented, specially accomodation -- you can find really good deals way cheaper than Lisbon or Porto. It's a bit tourist but not a trap. Great green spaces to relax, however it's a hill city and climbing up and down might be a con for those with reduced mobility.",

But I've spent a lot of time in Windsor so I can provide some overview. Windsor is a border town across from Detroit, Michigan, USA. A lot of day-trippers visit from other areas of Ontario and Michigan to visit the Caesar's Casino, which is a very nice casino if you're into gaming. Other than that there's not much to do other than enjoy the views of the Detroit skyline from the riverwalk. I always feel safe in Windsor. Like most of Canada, Windsor is expensive, but internet service and other infrastructure are great for working. Winters are extreme. Some Canadians have anti-American attitudes, unfortunately. If you're American be prepared to ignore these people and focus your time on the friendly locals.",

They are burning in the mountains and you can see the smoke going up to the sky.  And in the city it is not much better, the air is very much polluted there as well. I tried many restaurants but mostly the food is not very good and the service is depressingly bad. Combine that with the rubbish you see everywhere (especially around the center) and Da Lat makes not a happy place.",

(not including food courts in malls they are cheap) - If you want to cook the best places to buy food are the fresh markets and wet markets in terms of price.  - Stores like Tesco and Big C are cheap but again in the long run it adds up.  Attractions - Not too many places to visit here - If you have a car you can go to Buriram to see the historical places like Phanom Rung and other ruins  WiFi - A lot of free wifi in the malls and hotels - Hotel wifi - some are good and some are very bad even if it's a higher end hotel wifi can be bad - Mall wifi is fine - connects most of the time and sometimes it cuts off - the speed is okay - I found in general wifi allover the kingdom is pretty much the same in terms of speed and sustained connection",
